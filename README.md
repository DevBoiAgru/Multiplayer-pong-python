# Simple multiplayer pong game in python

## How to play:
- Open network.py and change the ip and port to whatever you want (This will be used by the server)
- Run server using `python server.py`
- Run client using `python client.py <server-ip> <port>`
- Once running, a pygame window should open with a white circle in the middle
- The game will start when the second client joins the game

## Controls:
W for moving the paddle up, S for moving the paddle down

## Dependencies
- Pygame (for the client)

### Pong.py is a simple pong game. Control the left paddle with w/s and the right paddle with up/down arrow keys

## I made this game to learn about sockets and tcp connections so its very rough, and very far from a finished product.
